            <a href="https://maxbittker.com/" target="_blank">Portfolio Link</a>
            <div>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?<br><br>When I first viewed the website, I was overwhelmed with pop-up tabs that resembled windows’ tabs.</div>
            <div>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.<br><br><li>By selecting the "x" button in the tabs’ top right corner, I was able to shut every tab.</li><li>Each time I close a tab, more tabs will appear on the webpage.</li><li>There were three interactive tabs that worked similarly to a mini boolean interactive game.</li><li>I was taken to an interface where I could draw, write, erase and send a letter to the creator by selecting the "send me a letter" tab.</li></div>
            <div>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? <br><br>The "send a letter" interface is where I spent the most time because I could input random messages and use the drawing tool to scatter particles throughout the webpage. My letter to the website's author will then disintegrate into tiny particles after pressing the "send" button.</div>  
            <div>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? <br><br>Closing the tabs by clicking the "x" button on each tab was my most common action throughout my interaction with the experience</div>
            <div>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? <br><br>I believe its main objective is to showcase the website’s author works, past projects, and a glimpse of his personal life</div>
            <div>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? <br><br>The 'F' pattern, a common reading pattern, is effectively used by the author. A webpage's layout made it simple for me to scan. I was able to understand the material on the webpage with ease because of the usage of colours with varying saturation and value. The author additionally utilised blue lettering to tell me where to find out more about his projects and works. I can also tell his skills and expertise in programming from the little interactive tabs.</div>
            <div>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) <br><br>As most of the actions in this experience are irreversible, I would start by clicking on all of the interactive elements on the webpage. The next step is to click on the hyperlinks to find out more information about the contents. The last step is to close the tabs after I have finished interacting with them.</div>
            <div>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time? <br><br>I think it lacks clarity in communication to ensure I can find what I want, and create a smooth user experience for me. There should be clearer instructions on how to navigate the experience. Rather than for me to work it out myself repeatedly.</div>
            <div>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?<br><br>The experience consists of the author’s pictures, videos, and blog posts.</div>
            <div>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?<br><br>This experience does not include any interactive images. The blog postings, however, are hyperlinks that took me to another page upon clicking where the author discusses his works and projects; most of them include YouTube videos or image examples.</div>
            <div>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?<br><br>The blog post hyperlinks made the page more scannable because they provide both information about what is on the page and an idea of where to go next. Generally, it improves the website’s appearance by keeping things neat.</div>
            <div>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?<br><br>In my opinion, it's very frustrating that there were little to no 'back’ buttons during my experience. For instance, closing the tabs on a website is an action that cannot be undone; I would need to reload the page. Moreover, inadequate grouping and headlines for the author's contents made navigation difficult throughout my experience.</div>
            <div>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?<br><br>Besides all the satisfying mini interactive activities on the webpage. The visual design choices of the webpage is one of the aspects I find most satisfying during my experience. The use of effective colour palette, font consistency and its textual content generally provided a pleasing experience for me.</div>
